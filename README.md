# Google Merch Shop - Website Report

[Google Merchandise Store](https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/) is an online store that sells Google-branded merchandise. The site uses Google Analytics 4's standard web ecommerce implementation along with enhanced measurement. In this project, I use the public [`ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce&t=events_20210131&page=table) dataset (01/11/2020 - 31/01/2021) available in BigQuery to build a report that focuses on key website KPIs, using Looker Studio.

From the original data, I created three smaller tables and imported them from BigQuery to Looker Studio to build the report. The full report can be accessed at [https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/1c37ce2e-3fdc-4abd-b9e2-91920371ed01](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/1c37ce2e-3fdc-4abd-b9e2-91920371ed01)
